Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Twisting the strangle grip
Won't give no mercy
Feeling those tendons rip
Torn up and mean
Blastmaster racks the ground
Bent on survival
Full throttle hammers down
A deadly scream
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
Forced into overdrive
Drawn out of anger
All talons poison dipped
Impaling spike
Heart pounding fever pitch
Blood pumping fury
Two fisted dynamo
Eager to strike
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
Cross cutting thunder charge
Blade of destruction
Flame throwing hurricane
Destroys the cage
Bone crushing alien
God of salvation
Sad wings that heaven sent
Wipes out in rage
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
All guns, all guns blazing
The sun rose, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink. A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves of the ancient oak tree, its branches reaching towards the heavens like gnarled fingers. Birds sang their morning melodies, a
chorus of chirps and trills that filled the air.  A small stream trickled over smooth stones, its waters sparkling in the sunlight. The scent of wildflowers drifted on the breeze, a sweet and intoxicating fragrance. A farmer
walked his fields, checking on his crops, his weathered face etched with years of hard work and dedication.  A child laughed, chasing butterflies through a meadow, her joy infectious. A dog barked, greeting the morning with
enthusiasm. The world awoke, stretching and yawning, ready to embrace a new day. The sun rose, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink. A gentle breeze rustled through the leaves of the ancient oak tree, its branches reaching
